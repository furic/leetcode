# Precomputed Product Table | 38 Lines | O(k²+q) | 17ms

# Intuition
The problem requires us to decompose a number into its constituent powers of 2 (binary representation), then efficiently answer range product queries on this array. The key insight is that we can extract powers of 2 using bit manipulation, and since there can be multiple queries, precomputing all possible range products in a 2D table will allow us to answer each query in O(1) time.

# Approach
I'll use bit manipulation for extraction and a 2D precomputation table for queries:

1. **Extract Powers of 2**: Use bit manipulation to extract all powers of 2 that sum to n:
   - Use `n & -n` to get the lowest set bit (rightmost power of 2)
   - Use XOR to remove this bit and continue until n becomes 0
   - This gives us the powers array in ascending order

2. **Precompute Products**: Build a 2D table where `productTable[i][j]` stores the product of elements from index i to j:
   - Diagonal elements are single powers: `table[i][i] = powers[i]`
   - Other elements use recurrence: `table[i][j] = table[i][j-1] * powers[j]`
   - Apply modulo arithmetic to prevent overflow

3. **Handle Large Numbers**: Use BigInt arithmetic during multiplication to prevent JavaScript number overflow, then convert back to number after applying modulo.

4. **Answer Queries**: Each query can be answered in O(1) time by looking up the precomputed table.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(k^2 + q)$$
  - Extracting k powers of 2 takes O(k) time where k ≤ log n ≤ 32
  - Building the 2D product table takes O(k²) time
  - Answering q queries takes O(q) time
  - Overall: O(k² + q) where k is typically small (≤ 32)

- Space complexity: $$O(k^2)$$
  - Powers array takes O(k) space
  - 2D product table takes O(k²) space
  - Query results array takes O(q) space
  - Dominated by the product table: O(k²)

# Code
```typescript []
const productQueries = (n: number, queries: number[][]): number[] => {
    const MODULO = 1000000007;
    
    const powersOf2Array: number[] = [];
    let remainingNumber = n;
    
    while (remainingNumber > 0) {
        const lowestPowerOf2 = remainingNumber & -remainingNumber;
        powersOf2Array.push(lowestPowerOf2);
        
        remainingNumber ^= lowestPowerOf2;
    }
    
    const tableSize = powersOf2Array.length;
    const productTable: number[][] = Array.from({ length: tableSize }, () => 
        new Array(tableSize).fill(0)
    );
    
    for (let startIndex = 0; startIndex < tableSize; startIndex++) {
        productTable[startIndex][startIndex] = powersOf2Array[startIndex];
        
        for (let endIndex = startIndex + 1; endIndex < tableSize; endIndex++) {
            const previousProduct = productTable[startIndex][endIndex - 1];
            const currentPower = powersOf2Array[endIndex];
            
            productTable[startIndex][endIndex] = 
                Number((BigInt(previousProduct) * BigInt(currentPower)) % BigInt(MODULO));
        }
    }
    
    const queryResults: number[] = new Array(queries.length);
    for (let queryIndex = 0; queryIndex < queries.length; queryIndex++) {
        const [leftIndex, rightIndex] = queries[queryIndex];
        queryResults[queryIndex] = productTable[leftIndex][rightIndex];
    }
    
    return queryResults;
};
