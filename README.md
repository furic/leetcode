A collection of LeetCode solutions implemented in TypeScript. This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, organized by problem ID and name.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each problem is organized in its own directory following the format:
```
{problem_id}-{problem_name}/
├── README.md        # Problem description and constraints
└── solution.ts      # TypeScript solution implementation
```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Navigate to the problem directory you're interested in
2. Read the `README.md` for problem description and constraints
3. Check the `solution.ts` file for the TypeScript implementation

## 📝 Current Solutions
